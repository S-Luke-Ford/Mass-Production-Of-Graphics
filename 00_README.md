# Mass Production Of Graphics
Program that mass-produces individualized recruiting graphics in Photoshop by adapting unique features such as name, jersey #, skin tone, and photos.

This program  quickly takes a recruit information data table and can produce hundreds of individualized graphics. Some of the major difference between this program and the options available through Photoshop are:
  1) Can adjust size and warp of text based on length of characters. This allows you to easily fit names onto jerseys, etc.
  2) Can take photos or headswaps of recruits and put them into the graphics.
  3) Can predermine subfolders of how you want the graphics to saved for easy dissemenation to coaching staff.

## 01_IntroductionVideo
Gives a quick introduction of the kind of graphics this program is capable of individualizing.

## 02_Script
Python code that walks you through how to implement the mass production of graphics. You should be able to download 03_FakeRecruitingDB and 04_JerseyPile.psd.zip and be able to start producing working graphics. I know longer have access to Photoshop, so some of the Photoshop folders and layers may be different and will need to be changed to match the code to the Photoshop layers. When an layer is in a folder you would need to use the layerSets["Name of Folder"]. Please note, this program will only work on Windows.

## 03_FakeRecruitingDB.csv
Provides a fake recruiting database with several different parameters.

## 04_JerseyPile.psd.zip
Provides a sample photoshop file where you can play around to see if your code makes the right adjustments to the graphic.
